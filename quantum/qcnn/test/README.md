A Julia implementation of a Quantum Convolutional Neural Network

Architecture includes layers of alternating two qubit rotations acting as the convolutional layer and pooling layers which act to reduce the number of qubits in each step.
Follows architecture from arXiv:2011.02966v1, arXiv:2108.00661v1, arXiv:2009.09423v1
